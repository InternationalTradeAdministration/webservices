    <content><![CDATA[<h1>Commerce Opens Doors to U.S. Elevators in Japan</h1><p>The Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) helped Pneumatic Vacuum Elevator LLC (PVE), a small-to-medium size enterprise (SME) headquartered in Miami, Florida, overcome a foreign trade barrier that threatened to exclude it from the Japanese market.</p><h2>Why it Matters</h2><p>If Japan had enacted its proposed new safety standard that was based on design rather than performance requirements, PVE would have lost $5 million in exports to Japan. Japan's decision to instead rely on a performance-based standard in keeping with its trade agreements opened doors to the Japanese construction market for other American businesses.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="Vacuum Elevator" src="http://informationportalprod/Files/commerce_opens_door.jpg" style="margin:5px;" /><br>Photo courtesy Pneumatic Vacuum Elevators, LLC</p><h2>The Problem</h2><p>Japan proposed requiring all residential elevator cabins to be manufactured using &quot;sliding&quot; doors. This new standard would exclude PVE from the Japanese market because its elevators use &quot;swinging&quot; doors. The proposed standard conflicted with Japan's World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations to specify technical standards in terms of performance, rather than design characteristics, when appropriate.</p><h2>The Solution</h2><p>A team of ITA specialists raised the issue to Japanese government officials and at the WTO, indicating that a specification based on performance rather than design would not keep Japan from meeting its safety goals. As a result of the team's actions, Japan revised the technical standard, permitting the use of swinging doors on residential elevators and averting the potential restriction of$5 millionin PVE's exports to Japan. PVE's representatives thanked the ITA for its &quot;tremendous support.&quot; The revised technical standard creates opportunities in Japan for other U.S. exporters of elevators with similar technology. </p><p>â€‹</p>]]></content>
