    <content><![CDATA[<h1><strong>The United States—Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) </strong></h1><h2><strong>General Information</strong></h2><p>Upon entry into force of the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 2004, 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial goods exports to Chile immediately became duty free. Tariffs on the remaining products have been nearly phased out, with 100 percent of products set to be duty free by 2015. To be eligible for tariff-free treatment under the FTA, products must meet the relevant rules of origin.</p><p>The FTA also provides favorable access for U.S. service suppliers and guarantees of protection to U.S. investors and U.S. copyrights, trademarks and patents registered in Chile. In addition, Chile has opened up significant government procurements to U.S. bidders. </p><p>Chile's open economy and strong democratic institutions make it one of the most stable countries for doing business in the region. The U.S.-Chile FTA also provides a framework that makes Chile an ever better place to do business.</p><p>U.S. goods exports to Chile increased 548 percent in the 10 years since the FTA went into effect, from $2.7 billion in 2003 to $17.6 billion in 2013. In 2013, Chile's economy grew by 4.4 percent and its inflation remained below 2 percent. </p><h2>By Sector</h2><p>Principal U.S. exports to Chile in 2013 were mineral fuel and oil, machinery, vehicles, electrical machinery, and aircraft and parts. U.S. exports of services to Chile have also grown substantially, reaching over $3.2 billion in 2012. </p><h2>Additional Information</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/chile-fta">U.S. – Chile Free Trade Agreement legal text</a></li><li><a href="http://export.gov/salesandmarketing/eg_main_018203.asp">Trade Information Center</a></li><li><a href="http://export.gov/chile/">U.S. Commercial Office in Chile</a> </li><li><a href="http://export.gov/eac/index.asp"><span class="ms-rteStyle-Emphasis">U.S. Export Assistance Center in your neighborhood</span></a></li></ul><p>​</p>]]></content>
