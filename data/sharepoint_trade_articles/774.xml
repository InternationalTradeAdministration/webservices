Most companies with a U.S.-made product available for export overseas will qualify for assistance. </p><p>Typically, U.S. exporters will use our services to seek a manufacturer's representative, distributor, buyers, or franchisees in non-U.S. markets. </p><p>We may decline the following for posting to overseas U.S. Commercial Service websites: </p><ul><li>Products of companies that do not provide complete or accurate information when registering </li><li>Products which, in the local market for which a posting is requested, are currently not viable due to local market regulation or other conditions </li><li>Products which, if listed in a particular local website's directory, may hurt the overall effectiveness of the website by offending local norms </li><li>Products of companies without a functioning online presence (website or webpage), such that we are unable to obtain an appropriate image </li></ul><p>The final determination of the suitability of a listing will be made by the management of each U.S. Commercial Service overseas office for which a listing on the local website is requested, or by the Featured U.S. Exporters Program Manager. </p><p>Unfortunately, due to the high volume of requests for listings, we are unable to respond to requests from companies that do not qualify for participation. If you are unsure, please contact a Trade Specialist at your nearest <a href="http://export.gov/usoffices/index.asp">Export Assistance Center</a> first, before registering. </p>]]></content>
