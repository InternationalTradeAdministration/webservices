    <content><![CDATA[<p>​<img src="http://informationportalprod/Files/Granite_State_DEC.png" alt="" style="margin:5px;" /></p><p>The District Export Councils (DECs) contribute leadership and international trade expertise to complement the U.S. Commercial Service's export promotion efforts through counseling businesses on the exporting process and conducting trade education and community outreach.</p><p>Closely affiliated with the Commerce Department's U.S. Export Assistance Centers, the DECs combine the energies of nearly 1,500 exporters and export service providers who support the U.S. Government's export promotion efforts throughout the country!</p><p>Learn more about the<strong>Granite State DEC</strong>by joining the LinkedIn Group: &quot;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=2154437">Granite State Export Exchange</a>.&quot;</p><h2>What is a DEC and what is its mission?</h2><p>DECs are organizations of leaders from the local business community, appointed by successive Secretaries of Commerce, whose knowledge of international business provides a source of professional advice for local firms.</p><p>The Mission of the Granite State DEC is to encourage and support exports that strengthen local business, stimulate economic growth and create jobs. It participates in business expansion activities by working with the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service offices and its export promotion partners at the State and community level to support greater export activity within New Hampshire. This is accomplished by developing a &quot;hands-on&quot; business-centered trade assistance network that compliments existing counseling.</p><h2>Who are DEC members?</h2><p>DEC Members also include export trading or management company representatives; bankers; international lawyers and accountants; freight forwarders; and others whose profession supports the U.S. government's export promotion mission.</p><p>Recommendations for appointment are based on the individual's position in the local business community, knowledge of day-to-day international operations, interest in export development, and willingness and ability to devote time to the council.</p><p>The<strong>Granite State DEC</strong>currently has ten members representing a broad section of New Hampshire's businesses and organizations. They each have unique skill sets and experiences which serve to enhance New Hampshire's export community.</p><table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="ms-rteTable-default" style="text-align:center;"><tbody><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default" style="width:33.3333333333333%;"><h2>Name &amp; Title</h2></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default" style="width:33.3333333333333%;"><h2>Company</h2></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default" style="width:33.3333333333333%;"><h2>Location</h2></td></tr><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><strong>Grace Preston</strong>Chair</td><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><a href="http://www.securecare.com/">Secure Care Products, Inc.​</a></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default">Concord, NH</td></tr><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><strong>Karen Wyman</strong>Vice-Chair</td><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><a href="http://www.elbitsystems-us.com/">Elbit Systems of America (Kollsman)</a></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default">Merrimack, NH</td></tr><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><strong>Paula Newton</strong>Treasurer</td><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><a href="http://nhhtc.org/nhhtc-events/partner-projects/new-biomedical-forum/">New Hampshire BioMedical Council</a></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default">Greenland, NH</td></tr><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><strong>Justin Oslowski</strong>Executive Secretary</td><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><a href="http://export.gov/newhampshire/">U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Commercial Service</a></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default">Durham, NH</td></tr><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><strong>Ron Cook</strong>Member</td><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><a href="http://ranspell.com/">Ransmeier &amp; Spellman P.C.</a></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default">Concord, NH</td></tr><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><strong>Tom Horgan</strong>Member</td><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><a href="http://www.nhcuc.org/">New Hampshire College &amp; University Council</a></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default">Concord, NH</td></tr><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><strong>Stephanie Ritchie Logan</strong>Member</td><td class="ms-rteTable-default"><a href="http://www.badgerbalm.com/">W.S.

DECs may not raise funds for profit, or represent the U.S. Government.</p><p>The<strong>Granite State DEC</strong>has agreed upon the following objectives to support its Mission:</p><ul><li>To develop a strong Granite State DEC membership with diverse knowledge and expertise in the realm of exporting that compliments the counseling available through Federal and State export assistance.</li><li>To make those in the local business community not using Federal and State export assistance aware of their full range of counseling and services.</li><li>To educate and assist the community in matters related to exporting, especially nuanced subjects that can only be obtained through first-hand experiences and international travel.</li><li>To undertake fundraising activities in order to sustain and grow the promotional and support activities of the DEC and invest in further export promotion efforts and opportunities.</li><li>To use DEC funds as direct company grants to include, but not limited to, U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service and State of NH export promotion services and activities.</li><li>To secure Federal, State of NH and other funding sources to support the export promotion activities of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service.</li></ul><h2>How were DECs formed?</h2><p>In 1960, the President asked the Secretary of Commerce to enlist the efforts of the U.S. business community in enlarging export opportunities for American firms. Responding to this challenge, the National Export Expansion Council was formed.</p><p>In response to National Export Expansion Council recommendations and to stimulate greater business participation in the national export expansion effort, the President signed an Executive Order in 1973 that directed the Secretary of Commerce to establish District Export Councils throughout the United States.</p><p>Under the Secretary's guidelines, the District Export Councils were specifically created to promote exports in their local communities. DECs are not advisory committees and are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). As a volunteer group, DECs do not receive government appropriations or compensation. They also do not have access to classified information and therefore, do not have security clearances.</p><p>The newly-formed<strong>Granite State DEC</strong>members have agreed to:</p><ul><li>Volunteer their time to sponsor and participate in trade promotion activities which support New Hampshire's export community.</li><li>Offer expertise in various fields of exporting to the State's small and medium-sized business. This expertise compliments the services and counseling offered by government export-promotion agencies.</li><li>Serve as a mentoring group which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises which are new to export or new to particular international markets. This mentoring will also include assistance with the cornerstones of exporting, including marketing, logistics, legal and financial matters, among others.</li><li>Facilitate the development of an effective export assistance network and provide support in coordinating activities of trade assistance partners to leverage all available resources.</li></ul><h2>Visit our new page for export updates!</h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.export.gov/newhampshire/updatesforexporters/index.asp" style="line-height:1.6;">Updates for Exporters</a><br></li></ul><p></p>]]></content>
