    <content><![CDATA[<p><img alt="EBRD wall sign" src="http://informationportalprod/Files/services%20for%20us%20companies.jpg" style="margin:5px;" />​​</p><p>The U.S. Commercial Service Business Liaison Office at the EBRD offers some of the same services that a regular CS office offers but because we report to the Advocacy Center located in Washington, DC there is no charge for services. Our CS EBRD Business office combines many of the well known CS services such as the Gold Key, into one category called &quot;<em>Single Company Promotion</em>&quot; and based on time we perform these in the morning and/or afternoon at the Bank. A <em>Single Company Promotion</em> involves up to four meetings with Bankers and an opportunity to tell your company's history and interest in the 30 countries of operation of the EBRD. We provide counseling and opportunities to receive twice monthly e-procurements from the EBRD website with a link to our website. </p>]]></content>
