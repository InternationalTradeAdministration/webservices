    <content><![CDATA[<h1>Compliance Attachés<img class="ms-rtePosition-2" src="http://informationportalprod/Files/compliance_attaches.jpg" alt="" style="margin:5px;" /></h1><p>Foreign Commercial Service officers—trade compliance attachés—are at the forefront of efforts by the International Trade Administration (ITA) to create a barrier-free global trading system. Attachés are officers in the field and the leads for implementing the ITA Trade Agreements Compliance program at their posts. Those strategic posts are located in the U.S. Mission to the European Union in Brussels, and the U.S. Embassies in Beijing, and El Salvador. The program endeavors to reduce or eliminate foreign government policies that adversely affect trade opportunities for U.S. goods and services.</p><p>Compliance attachés are:</p><ul><li>experts on trade barrier identification,</li><li>trained in the latest state-of-the-art tools and techniques to attack those barriers, and</li><li>adept at leveraging the combined trade and commercial expertise all across ITA to achieve the best results for U.S. companies facing trade barriers abroad.</li></ul><p>Although compliance attachés focus on dismantling trade barriers, they also help ensure trade policy consistency between post and Department of Commerce headquarters, support senior-level ITA interaction with foreign government officials, and educate local U.S. companies and regional government personnel on ITA's approach to knocking down foreign government trade barriers.</p><p>For more information on the ITA Trade Agreements Compliance Program, to report a foreign government trade barrier, or to contact an attaché, visit <a href="http://trade.gov/tcc"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">www.trade.gov/tanc</span></a>.</p><p>​</p>]]></content>
