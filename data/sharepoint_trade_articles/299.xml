    <content><![CDATA[<h1><strong>The United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement</strong></h1><h2><strong>General Information</strong></h2><p>As a result of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, tariffs that averaged 4.3 percent were eliminated on more than 99% of the tariff lines for U.S. manufactured goods exports to Australia. Exports of these goods account for 93% of total U.S. goods sales in Australia's market. The eventual elimination of all tariffs will create new export opportunities for America's manufacturers. </p><p>The FTA also affords substantial benefits in a broad range of other sectors as well. Markets for services such as life insurance and express delivery will be opened; intellectual property will be better protected; American investments will be facilitated through predictable access and a stable business environment. For the first time in many sectors, American firms will be allowed to compete for Australia's government purchases on a nondiscriminatory basis. All U.S. farm exports will go duty-free to Australia, benefiting many sectors such as processed foods, fruits and vegetables, corn, and soybeans. The FTA also makes advances in e-commerce and pharmaceutical market access. A summary describing all of these benefits is available at <a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/australian-fta"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">the USTR website. </span></a></p><h2><strong>By Sector</strong></h2><p>With virtually all U.S. manufactured exports becoming duty-free immediately, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates that the manufacturing sector could sell $2 billion more per year to Australia and that U.S. national income could grow by nearly that much. </p><p>U.S. exports to Australia grew 11% in 2010, with the sectors of mining, organic farming, and motorcycles growing the fastest in Australia. Overall, the principal U.S. exports to Australia in 2010 are in the sectors of machinery, vehicles; not railway, optic/medical instruments, and electrical machinery. </p><h2><strong>Additional Resources</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/us_fta/index.html"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade U.S.-Australia FTA website</span></a></li><li><a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://export.gov/exportbasics/eg_main_017483.asp"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Trade Information Center</span></a></li><li><a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://export.gov/australia"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">U.S. Commercial Office in Australia</span></a> </li><li><a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://export.gov/eac/index.asp"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">U.S. Export Assistance Center in your neighborhood</span></a></li></ul><p> </p><p>â€‹</p>]]></content>
