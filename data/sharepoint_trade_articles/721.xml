PNC earned this award by demonstrating a commitment to proactively generate and support U.S. exports through offering trade finance services, which grew by 30% in 2003 alone. PNC not only directs its activities towards overseas importers, but educates small and medium-sized enterprises on how to use their financing to expand their export sales. PNC has worked closely with the U.S. Commercial Service, taking advantage of their export counseling expertise and other client-specific services. PNC's trade finance services have enabled the region to experience an increase in exporting activity and bolstered the regional economy.</span><br></p><p><br></p>]]></content>
