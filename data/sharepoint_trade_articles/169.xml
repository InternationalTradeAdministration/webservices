    <content><![CDATA[<p>An export license grants permission to conduct a certain type of export transaction. It is issued by the appropriate licensing agency after a careful review of the facts surrounding the given export transaction. Most export transactions do not require specific approval in the form of licenses from the U.S. Government. In fact, a relatively small percentage of all U.S. export transactions require licenses from the U.S. government. It is up to the exporter to determine whether the product requires a license and to research the end use of the product, in other words, to perform &quot;due diligence&quot; regarding the transaction. Exporters should learn which federal department or agency has jurisdiction over the item they are planning to export in order to find out if a license is required.</p><h2>Export Control Reform Initiative*</h2><p>The Administration is engaged in a fundamental reform of the U.S. export control system to enhance U.S. national security and strengthen the United States' ability to counter threats such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
