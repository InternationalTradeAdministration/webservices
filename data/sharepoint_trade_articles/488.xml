    <content><![CDATA[<table width="100%" class="ms-rteTable-default" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default" style="width:100%;"><h2><img class="ms-rtePosition-1" src="http://informationportalprod/Files/advocacy%20center.jpg" alt="" style="margin:5px;" />WHO WE ARE</h2><p> The Advocacy Center is a unit of the <a href="http://trade.gov/markets/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Global Markets</span></a> bureau of the <a href="http://trade.gov/about.asp"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">International Trade Administration</span></a>, <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">U.S. Department of Commerce</span></a>.</p><h2>WHAT WE DO</h2><p> Based in Washington, D.C., the Advocacy Center coordinates U.S. government interagency advocacy efforts on behalf of U.S. exporters bidding on public-sector contracts with overseas governments and government agencies. We work very closely with the U.S. Commercial Service network of domestic <a href="http://export.gov/usoffices/index.asp"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Export Assistance Centers</span></a> and <a href="http://export.gov/worldwide_us/index.asp"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Commercial Offices within U.S. diplomatic missions overseas</span></a>.</p><p>The Advocacy Center helps to ensure that sales of U.S. products and services have the best possible chance competing abroad. Advocacy assistance is wide and varied but often involves companies that want the U.S. Government to communicate a message to foreign governments or government-owned corporations on behalf of their commercial interest, typically in a competitive bid contest. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since its creation in 1993, the Advocacy Center has helped hundreds of U.S. companies — small, medium and large enterprises in various industry sectors — to win government contracts across the globe. In short, we are your advocates! In pursuing foreign business opportunities, we encourage you and your company to contact us early and often.</p><p>The Advocacy Center also has <a href="http://export.gov/advocacy/eg_main_022753.asp"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Commercial Service liaisons to four Multilateral Development Banks</span></a> (World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Asia Development Bank) to assist U.S. firms and advocate on their behalf when they compete for Bank tenders. The liaisons counsel U.S. companies on how to work with the Banks and advocate on procurement and contracting issues to ensure fair and equal treatment for U.S. companies.</p><h2>Mission Statement</h2><p>Our mission is to coordinate U.S. Government resources and authority in order to level the playing field on behalf of U.S. business interests as they compete against foreign firms for specific international contracts or other U.S. export opportunities. In doing so, the Advocacy Center helps create and retain U.S. jobs through exports.</p><h2>Contact Information</h2><p>U.S. Department of Commerce<br><strong> The Advocacy Center</strong><br> 14th Street &amp; Constitution Avenue, N.W. — Rm. 2840 <br>Washington, DC 20230 <br>Office No.: (202) 482-3896</p>]]></content>
