Simmons products have been made in the Chicago area since 1946 and they have operated a distribution facility in the Los Angeles area since 1977. Simmons has become the world leader in slicing blades used in the foam, food, leather, plastics and aerospace industries and exports to 50 countries. The relationship between Simmons Engineering Corp. and the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) started in July, 2013. Since that time, Simmons has used CS to conduct two International Partner Searches (IPS). The first IPS was completed in November 2013 and resulted in a sizable initial order from a new distributor in Russia, a market that was not serviced by Simmons in the past. A second IPS in the Turkish market is currently under way and the results look very promising. Simmons Engineering Corporation credits the positions for 12 employees and their ability to ride out the economic downturn directly to their export success.</p><p><br></p><h2>2013 Winners:</h2><h3>2013 President's &quot;E&quot; Awards Ceremony – Honoring 57 U.S. Companies and Organizations that Export Goods or Services</h3><p>On May 20, 2013, Acting Secretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank honored 57 U.S. companies and organizations that export goods or services at the 2013 President's &quot;E&quot; Awards ceremony.
