  Atom__c: 'Safe Harbor benefits are assured from the date on which an organization
    self-certifies to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) its adherence to
    the Principles in accordance with the guidance set forth below. To self-certify
    for the Safe Harbor, organizations can provide to the Department of Commerce (or
    its designee) a letter signed by a corporate officer on behalf of the organization
    that is joining the Safe Harbor that contains at least the following information:
    Name of the organization, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers;
    Description of the activities of the organization with respect to personal information
    received from Switzerland; and Description of the organizations privacy policy for
    such personal information, including: where the privacy policy is available for
    viewing by the public, its effective date of implementation, a contact office for
    the handling of complaints, access requests, and any other issues arising under
    the Safe Harbor, the specific statutory body that has jurisdiction to hear any claims
    against the organization regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations
    of laws or regulations governing privacy (and that is listed in the annex to the
    Principles), the name of any privacy programs in which the organization is a member,
    the method of verification (e.g., in-house, third party) (see FAQ 7: Verification),
    and the independent recourse mechanism that is available to investigate unresolved
    complaints. Where the organization wishes its Safe Harbor benefits to cover human
    resources information transferred from Switzerland for use in the context of the
    employment relationship, it may do so where there is a statutory body with jurisdiction
    to hear claims against the organization arising out of human resources information
    that is listed in the annex to the Principles. In addition, the organization must
    indicate this in its letter and declare its commitment to cooperate with the Commissioner
    or authorities concerned in conformity with the FAQ 9: Human Resources and the FAQ
    5: The Role of the Commissioner as applicable and that it will comply with the advice
    given by such authorities. The Department (or its designee) will maintain a list
    of all organizations that file such letters, thereby assuring the availability of
    Safe Harbor benefits, and will update such list on the basis of annual letters and
    notifications received pursuant to the FAQ 11: Dispute Resolution and Enforcement.
    Such self-certification letters should be provided not less than annually. Otherwise
    the organization will be removed from the list and Safe Harbor benefits will no
    longer be assured. Both the list and the self-certification letters submitted by
    the organizations will be made publicly available. All organizations that self-certify
    for the Safe Harbor must also state in their relevant published privacy policy statements
    that they adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles. The undertaking to adhere to the
    Safe Harbor Principles is not time-limited in respect of data received during the
    period in which the organization enjoys the benefits of the Safe Harbor. Its undertaking
    means that it will continue to apply the Principles to such data for as long as
    the organization stores, uses or discloses them, even if it subsequently leaves
    the Safe Harbor for any reason. An organization that will cease to exist as a separate
    legal entity as a result of a merger or a takeover must notify the Department of
    Commerce (or its designee) of this in advance. The notification should also indicate
    whether the acquiring entity or the entity resulting from the merger will: (1) continue
    to be bound by the Safe Harbor Principles by the operation of law governing the
    takeover or merger or (2) elect to self-certify its adherence to the Safe Harbor
    Principles or put in place other safeguards, such as a written agreement that will
    ensure adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. Where neither (1) nor (2) apply,
    any data that has been acquired under the Safe Harbor must be promptly deleted.
    An organization does not need to subject all personal information to the Safe Harbor
    Principles, but it must subject to the Safe Harbor Principles all personal data
    received from Switzerland after it joins the Safe Harbor. Any misrepresentation
    to the general public concerning an organizations adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles
    may be actionable by the Federal Trade Commission or other relevant government body.
    Misrepresentations to the Department of Commerce (or its designee) may be actionable
    under the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).'
