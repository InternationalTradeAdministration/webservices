    <i><b>Interview By Roza Pace, Trade Specialist, U.S. Department of Commerce</b></i><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><b>Q: Why Should U.S Academic Institutions Pursue International Student Recruitment </b></i><br>As you can see from the above introduction, the economic benefits are great, in the billions of dollars. NAFSA (NAFSA.org) conducts an annual state-by-state and <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/" target="_blank">congressional district </a>analysis of the economic contributions of international students and their families to the U.S. economy. Enhancing networking opportunities and sharing our ideals are additional benefits. Polish students are definitely part of this mix.<br><br>Attracting international students helps U.S. schools increase their international ranking. The mark of a top university is its ability to be a major player in the international education market and its ability to attract international students. Additional benefits for universities to name a few, include internationalizing college experience, making U.S. college graduates better acquainted with global trends, improving foreign language acquisition, and helping US students to understand the world better.<br><br><i><b>Q: What makes the United States an attractive destination for foreign students?</b></i><br>The U.S. educational system at the college level offers unparalleled experiences for international students. Fourteen of the top twenty universities in the world are located in the United States. According to the Institute of International Education, there are more international students studying at American institutions than anywhere else in the world. Students from Eastern Europe represent only a fraction (less than 5 per cent) of all students that come to the United States from Europe. The combination of world-class education and opportunity to connect with the world in one place of study is truly a unique experience that is hard to find anywhere else in the world.<br><br><i><b>Q: Why should U.S. academic institutions look at recruiting Polish students?</b></i><br>The number of Polish Students enrolled in non-degree programs in the United States has increased by 28 per cent since 2010/11 academic year. The U.S. and Poland share a long history of supporting democratic principles and values. Poles also admire America for its political strength and scientific achievements which can be, in large part, attributed to the education system. American universities, governments, and businesses have been conducting scientific exchanges and cooperating on innovation and technology advancements. Increasing the number of Polish students pursuing degrees in the U.S. will build on the important advances that have already been made in education. Polish students being members of European community do have access to excellent education in the region and Polish graduates will doubtfully become business and political leaders in Europe. While European education is much less expensive for Polish students, U.S. universities are attractive as they have a wider international outlook and generally include a more diverse international student body. Even a college with a mostly domestic population will often have a multi-cultural student body, offering the student a diverse learning environment.<br>Some key highlights on the significance of the Polish student market:<br><br>• Poland is a prime target for U.S. educational institutions from which they can successfully recruit both undergraduate and graduate students. The Polish market represents the sixth largest country in the European Union in terms of population, but also, from a demographic standpoint.</span></span>
    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">• The academic and cultural value that these students contribute to American universities is significant however these students also bring a great deal of financial clout to American campuses and local communities.</span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">• Poland is a prime target from which U.S. educational institutions can successfully recruit both undergraduate and graduate students. This market not only represents the sixth largest country in the European Union in terms of population, but also, from a demographic standpoint.</span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">• According to Daniel Kantowski, an educational consultant in Poland, the EU has almost 4,000 higher education institutions with 434 of them in Poland. With only 7% of EU population, Poland accounts for some 11% institutions of higher education with only about a 100 are public.</span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">• In 2014/2015 344,000 Polish students were admitted to higher level learning institutes of which 75.6% students were enrolled in public schools.</span></span><br> </p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><b><i>Q: What are some additional benefits from recruiting in Poland or elsewhere in Central Europe? </i></b><br>• Diversify international student populations<br>• Avoid reliance on only a few countries for international students<br>• Create an international programs division<br>• Use international education and exchange as a powerful tool</span></span><br><br><img alt="Polish Students in the US" height="308" src="https://trade--c.na21.content.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka7t0000000Calq&amp;feoid=00Nt0000000SZI2&amp;refid=0EMt0000000PE4L" width="500"></img></p>

    <p><br><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><b>Q: What are some of the most popular universities for Polish students?</b></i><br>University of Chicago, the University of Virginia, New York University Harvard, Rutgers University and Columbia are some of the most popular ones. There are many other universities that Polish students choose however the overall number of Polish students studying there are small. While many elite Polish students are interested in top universities in the United States, they may be able to find excellent educational experiences in smaller or less known universities as well as community colleges, for example, other places such as Lewis and Clark College or University of South Florida. Some of these colleges offer a limited number of scholarships to international students.</span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><b>Q: Can you share specific examples of success stories such as prominent Poles politicians, artists, actors, businessmen, engineers, athletes or entrepreneurs educated in the United States?</b></i><br><br>There are countless examples of Polish students and professionals who, after studying in the U.S., have returned to invest in the Polish economy. These include experts in high technology, engineering, business, finance, medicine, law, and more.<br>Several senior government officials studied in the U.S. Two examples of Polish high ranking government officials studying in the US are: (FYI, the new government was established in mid-November 2015):</span></span><br> </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">• Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Development:  Central Connecticut State University. Uzyskał dyplom MBA na Akademii Ekonomicznej we Wrocławiu. est także absolwentem Uniwersytetu w Hamburgu, Uniwersytetu w Bazylei oraz Kellog School of Management Uniwersytetu Northwestern, Evanston w Stanach Zjednoczonych.           <br><br>• Paweł Szałamacha, Minister of Finance:  graduate of  Law and Administration Department at  Adama Mickiewicz University in Poznan and a College d&#39;Europe w Brugii, completed studies at John F. Kennedy School of Government Uniwersytetu at Harvard, where he graduated with Master in Public Administration (Mid-Career MPA), specializing in organization and management.      <br>      <br>• Many CEOs of Polish firms studied or have a strong affiliation with U.S. universities. For example, Bogusława Skowrońska is the owner and co-founder of Capital Solutions proAlfa Sp. z o.o., and serves as a certified advisor on the NewConnect segment of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. She graduated from Harvard University (MBA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Through her outreach and alumni connections, Ms. Skowrońska has helped encourage many Polish students to study in the United States.  </span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The chart below covers a number of options students from Poland should consider, especially with some of the options being more competitively priced than others.<br><br><img alt="Recruitment Tips" height="295" src="https://trade--c.na21.content.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka7t0000000Calq&amp;feoid=00Nt0000000SZI2&amp;refid=0EMt0000000PE4Q" width="500"></img><br> </span></span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><b>U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, U.S. Commercial Service</b></i></span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><b>What are some specific challenges prospective students from Poland may face?</b></i> <br>• cost of studies compared with average income in Poland,<br>• current exchange rates that reflect a strong dollar<br>• the lack of a visa waiver program<br>• financing</span></span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The availability of scholarships both from Polish Institutions and from American ones may help overcome some of these challenges. Where a student cannot pay full fare, merit scholarships for most competitive students may bring non-monetary value to a university. While financial aid is not available for international students, some universities like Jacksonville University offer merit scholarships based on recalculated GPA. International students who need additional financial assistance may also work on campus for up to 20 hours each week.<br><br><i><b>Q: What type of visa student would need to study in the United States?</b></i><br>International students are granted a J-1 cultural exchange visa to study in the United States and they may be required to return to their home country at the completion of the scholarship to share their experience with their fellow students and countrymen. Additional visa information may be obtained at: <a href="http://travel.state.gov" target="_blank">http://travel.state.gov</a> from the United States Department of State website.<br><br><br> <img alt="Polish Education System" height="327" src="https://trade--c.na21.content.force.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka7t0000000Calq&amp;feoid=00Nt0000000SZI2&amp;refid=0EMt0000000PE4V" width="500"></img></span></span><br><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><b>U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, U.S. Commercial Service</b></i></span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><i><b>Resources page</b></i><br><i><b>Potential resources Polish students may consider when applying to study in the US:</b></i></span></span></p>

    <ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">U.S. colleges offer little aid to foreign undergraduate students unless they happen to be talented athletes or winners of major international science competitions. However, a number of places offer scholarships or have special programs to help foreign students, especially top international students with high grades and strong leadership capabilities. Individual schools are more likely to offer grants and scholarships for international students/foreign students who prove themselves superior in their fields of study.      </span></span></li></ul>
    <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">  </span></span>

    <ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It may be a bit easier to secure financial aid while in graduate school as graduate and teaching assistantships and fellowships are offered to students with proven academic records, regardless of whether they are foreign students / international students or US citizens. However, some schools will not consider students for fellowships or assistantships until their second year of study.</span></span></li></ul>
     

    <ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There is financial aid available for international students/foreign students to study in the US, but it takes great initiative and a strong determination to secure it.</span></span></li></ul>
