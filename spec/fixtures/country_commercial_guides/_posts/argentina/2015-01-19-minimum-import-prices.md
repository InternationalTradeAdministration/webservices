In May 2001, the Government of Argentina (GOA) introduced minimum import prices/reference values on several products covered by specific HS codes to avoid under-invoicing. When the minimum import price is greater than the declared value at Customs, the importer must make a deposit for taxes due on the price differential to take merchandise out of customs. This deposit will be held during the period of investigation on the real or market import price. These minimum import prices apply when goods are imported for consumption.

In 2005, in an attempt to continue adjusting mechanisms against tax evasion in import operations, the GOA issued Secretariat of Industry Resolutions 1907 and 1908. These regulations created a new system to determine “reference import values” (_valores criterio_) for products to be compared with the value declared at Customs by the importer, and impose stricter conditions to import when the declared unitary FOB value represents less than 80 percent of the reference value. In these cases, the import process will continue, but the importer will bear additional restrictions such as:

•	Increase on Valued Added Tax (VAT) and Income Tax paid on imports, reaching rates of 21 percent and 11 percent respectively, depending on the product type.

•	Loss of tax benefits such as exemption or deferment of VAT and Income Tax payments.
 
•	Deposit of a guarantee equivalent of the difference between the reference value and the declared value. Deposit/guarantee policies are no longer accepted for these cases. Only cash, bank collaterals, or public debt bonds will serve as a guarantee to allow the import transaction.

Several subsequent regulations have continued to update and expand the list of minimum/reference prices. In 2008, Customs Notes 90 and 91 required importers of any goods from designated countries that are invoiced below the reference prices to have the invoice validated by both the foreign customs agency and the appropriate Argentine Embassy or Consulate. U.S. products with reference prices include:

•	Matches

•	Other plates, sheets, film, foil and strip, of plastics, non-cellular and not reinforced, laminated, supported or similarly combined with other materials: of poly (methyl methacrylate), not over 25mm or over 105mm in thickness

•	Rubber bicycle tubes

•	Wooden hangers

•	Non-rewritable compact discs (CD-R)

•	Fungicides

•	Electrical terminals

•	Low density polyethylene

•	Cermet manufactures

•	Fiberglass tissue

•	Iron and Steel tubes

•	Tires (new)

•	Refrigerators

•	Washing machines

At the same time, the Argentine Customs Bureau announced that there would be specific Customs checkpoints that will control imports of certain product categories such as household appliances, electronic devices, motorcycles, textiles, apparel, footwear and toys. These items are traditionally the most affected by import restrictions.
