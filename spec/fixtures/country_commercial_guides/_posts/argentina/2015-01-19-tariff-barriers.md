MERCOSUR, created in 1991, gradually eliminated almost all non-tariff restrictions and other limitations to trade among its founding members (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). As of 2006, over 99 percent of all MERCOSUR tariff lines had been reduced to zero. Sugar has not yet been incorporated into MERCOSUR’s internal free trade regime, and certain other products such as autos and auto parts, while officially incorporated, are actively managed, including by the use of quantitative restrictions (quotas).

For countries outside the MERCOSUR area, Argentina and its MERCOSUR partners established the MERCOSUR Common External Tariff (CET) on January 1, 1995. The CET currently ranges from zero to 20 percent for most products. However, some products in the automotive sector can reach 35 percent.

There is a list of sensitive products temporarily exempted from the CET. The first group includes very sensitive products such as Information Technology and Capital Goods. At the same time, the MERCOSUR countries can set an import duty different from the CET until December 31, 2015 for specific products, using the so-called Exceptions List (pursuant to Decision 58/10 CMC MERCOSUR).

Starting in July 2012, imported capital goods that compete against local production have been subject to a 14 percent tariff. Imported capital goods that don't have a local substitute face a 2 percent tariff.

Information and telecommunications-related (IT) products are regulated by a separate tariff schedule, which expires on December 31, 2015. After this date, all import duties will begin to converge among MERCOSUR members according to a fixed schedule. Some goods not produced within MERCOSUR, such as newsprint, books, and certain petroleum products, pay 0 to 16 percent import duties.

The tariffs on imports apply to the declared CIF value in Argentina. In addition to the tariffs, the following fees and taxes apply:

•	0.5 percent statistics fee on the CIF value, with some exceptions. This fee is not levied on MERCOSUR intra-zone trade.

•	21 or 10.5 percent (depending on the product) of Value Added Tax (VAT) on the CIF value plus tariff and statistics fees.

•	20 or 10 percent (depending on the product) of advanced VAT on CIF plus tariff and statistics fees on all goods imported for resale. Goods imported directly by end-users are exempted.

•	Six percent profits tax on all retail goods, except for goods imported directly by users. Individuals pay 11 percent.

•	1.5 percent gross income tax

The CIF value plus the duty and the import statistics fee form the base for the application of domestic taxes. For this reason, foreign supplier's invoice must support the imports. VAT and Profits Tax are deductible from gross income tax.

Domestic taxes (i.e., excise taxes) are levied on tobacco, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, syrups, extracts and concentrates, television sets, tape recorders, record players, and microwave appliances, among other products. Excise taxes are paid on the basis of sworn returns or through stamps affixed to the product. Rates vary considerably, reaching up to 60 percent of the retail price for cigarettes.
 
Decree 690/2002 specifies exceptions to the payment of the statistics fee, which include:

•	Certain imported goods for animal or vegetable reproduction, which pay a zero percent CET.

•	Certain imported mineral products that pay zero percent CET.

•	Imported books, brochures, and newsprint.

•	New imported capital and IT-related goods.

•	Goods imported under the temporary import regime.
