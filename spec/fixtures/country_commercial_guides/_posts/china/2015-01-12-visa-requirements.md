A valid passport and visa are required to enter China. A visa must be obtained from Chinese Embassies and Consulates before traveling to China; ask for a one-year, multiple-entry visa. Americans arriving without valid passports and the appropriate Chinese visa are not permitted to enter and can be subject to a fine and immediate deportation at the traveler's expense. Travelers should not rely on Chinese host organizations claiming to be able to arrange a visa upon arrival. Chinese authorities have recently tightened their visa issuance policy, in some cases requiring personal interviews of American citizens and regularly issuing one or two entry visas valid for short periods only.** The standard visa reciprocity is multiple entry/12 months and visitors should request a Chinese visa of that validity to avoid problems.**

Please note that visas are required to transit China in most circumstances. Persons transiting China on the way to and from Mongolia or North Korea or who plan to re-enter from the Hong Kong or Macau Special Administrative Regions should be especially sure to obtain visas allowing multiple entries.

For information about visa requirements and other entry requirements and restricted areas, travelers should consult the Embassy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) at 2300 Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, or telephone (202) 328-2500, 2501 or 2502. For a list of services and frequently asked visa questions and answers, travelers can view the Chinese Embassy's website at: [http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/).

The Chinese Embassy's visa section may be reached by e-mail at [chnvisa@bellatlantic.net](mailto:chnvisa@bellatlantic.net). The service hotline is (202) 337-1956 and the fax number is (202) 588-9760. There are Chinese Consulates General in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.

Americans traveling in Asia have been able to obtain visas to enter China from the Chinese visa office in Hong Kong and the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Seoul, South Korea, but Americans resident in the United States should apply for a visa before leaving, if possible.

**Americans who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their Chinese visas will be subject to a RMB 500 fine per day up to a maximum of RMB 5,000. **Although you can expect processing delays and receive a warning, you are not necessarily denied a new visa or have further action taken against you. In extreme cases, you could be expelled from the country and prohibited re-entry for 5 years. Travelers should note that international flights departing China are routinely overbooked. Travelers are advised to reconfirm departure reservations and check in early at the airport. **Note that if you lose your passport or become the victim of passport theft, you will not only need to obtain a new U.S. passport, but you will need to obtain a replacement visa before you will be able to depart China. This process can take as long as one week.**

In an effort to prevent international child abduction, many governments have initiated new procedures at entry/exit points. These often include requiring documentary evidence of relationship and permission for the child's travel from the parent(s) or legal guardian if they are not present. Having such documentation on hand, even if not required, may facilitate entry/departure.

U.S. companies that require travel of foreign businesspeople to the United States should be advised that, especially during the summer and during other busy travel times, there may be a significant wait time for applicants to schedule a visa interview and a small percentage of Chinese visa applicants, particularly those in scientific and technical fields, require additional processing that may take three weeks or more to complete. Chinese companies also usually require invitation letters and have internal travel approval process that may take several weeks. U.S. companies should send invitation letters to Chinese business contacts as early as possible. Visa applicants should go to the following links.
