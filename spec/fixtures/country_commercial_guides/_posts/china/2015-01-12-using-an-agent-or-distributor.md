China's fast-growing economy attracts international participation, including exports from U.S. small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Unlike large international or multinational companies that establish operations for branding, marketing and various business activities in China, SMEs with limited budgets, when expanding their business, usually start with fostering a sales network through regional agents or distributors. Sales agents and distributors, however, can assist in keeping track of policy and regulation updates, both locally and nationally, collect market data, and quickly respond to changes. In addition, U.S. SMEs can take advantage of existing networks enjoyed by their agents and distributors and expand their business through such contacts.

**Trading Companies**

China's current regulations are designed to allow manufacturing-focused foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) to become export trading companies that may purchase and export any products or technologies free from quotas, license controls or government monopoly. FIEs are able to establish trading companies and to obtain trading rights before the phase-in of distribution rights. Chinese companies that are registered and have RMB 1 million (US$148,000) in capitalization can obtain an import/export license.

In 2005, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) issued documents outlining the application procedures for investors to establish new foreign-invested commercial enterprises (FICEs), for existing FICEs to open new distribution and trading businesses, and for existing FIEs to expand their business scope. The documents give provincial-level agencies the authority to review and approve applications. Approval for new foreign enterprises occurs at the provincial level, and not the national level.

In 2006, MOFCOM issued a notice on "Entrusting Local Authorities with the Examination and Approval of Commercial Enterprises with Foreign Investment." While this decision to delegate approval authority to provincial-level authorities for most distribution rights has sped up the application process, technical challenges still remain. Existing foreign-invested manufacturers that have expanded their business scope are limited to distributing goods that they produce. Uncertainty over what constitutes "similar goods" has created difficulties for some companies seeking to exercise their distribution rights. In addition, existing manufacturers that have expanded their business scope to include distribution must ensure that half of their revenue stems from their buy-sell activity.

**Distributors**

A U.S. exporting company that hopes to successfully enter China must gain both trading and distribution rights. Distribution covers: 1) commission agent services, 2) wholesale services, and 3) retailing. Chinese law allows foreign companies to establish wholly-owned distribution entities for chemical fertilizers, processed oil and crude oil, as well as other imported and domestically produced products. Limits exist on products including books and periodicals, pharmaceutical products and pesticides. Foreign companies may choose one of two ways to acquire trading and distribution rights: they can set up a new, stand-alone FICE or apply to expand the business scope of an existing FIE.

Given the complexities of the Chinese market, foreign companies should also consider using a domestic Chinese agent for both importing into China and marketing within China. With careful selection, training, and constant contact, a U.S. exporter can obtain good market representation from a Chinese trading company, many of which are authorized to deal in a wide range of products. Some of the larger companies have offices in the U.S. and other countries around the world, as well as a network of offices and affiliates in China.

**Local Agents**

China has many local sales agents who handle internal distribution and marketing. Most of these firms do not have import/export authorization. They are the next layer down the distribution chain, buying foreign products and importing them through import/export licensees. These sales agents then pay a commission to the licensee. They may be representative offices of Hong Kong-based or other foreign trading companies, or domestic Chinese firms with regional or partial national networks.
