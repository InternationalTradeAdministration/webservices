**Banking System in China**

Cooperation and competition co-exist between Chinese banks and foreign banks in China.

	1.  Regulators: People's Bank of China and China Banking Regulatory
Commission

Tasked to formulate and implement monetary policy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) is China's central bank and reports to the State Council. The State Council, however, maintains oversight of the PBOC and makes all final decisions on China's major financial and monetary policy issues. According to the 1995 Central Bank Law, the PBOC has full autonomy in applying monetary instruments, including setting interest rates for commercial banks and trading in government bonds. It maintains the banking sector's payment, clearing and settlement systems, and manages official foreign exchange and gold reserves. The PBOC also oversees the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) in the setting of foreign exchange policies.

The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) was launched on April 28, 2003 to improve the efficiency of bank supervision and allow the PBOC to further focus on the country's macro-economic and currency policy and to take over the bank supervisory role from the PBOC. CBRC is responsible for the regulation and supervision of banks, asset management companies, trust and investment companies as well as other deposit-taking financial institutions. Its mission is to maintain a safe banking system in China.

	2. The "Big Five" Chinese Commercial Banks

The largest five state-owned banks in China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Bank of China (BOC), the China Construction Bank (CCB), the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), and Bank of Communications dominate the banking system and together account for well over half of all loans and deposits in China's banks. Several have become some of the largest banks in the world as valued by market capitalization. For example, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank are the world's largest and second largest banks by market value. While the State, operating through the Ministry of Finance, continues to own a majority stake in each of these institutions. These five banks all are publicly listed in Chinese stock markets and also on international bourses. The "Big Five" constitute the absolute majority of bank lending in China. Bank lending remains the most important financing vehicle in the country; equity finance and the corporate bond market remain very small in comparison, while bank lending constitutes roughly 80 percent of total lending. The majority profits of a Chinese bank comes from the difference between the interest rate paid to depositors and the lending rate to the borrowers, which a generous spread is set by the central bank in order to protect the banks from fierce competition.

	3. Policy Banks

Three "policy" banks-the Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC), the China Development Bank (CDB), and the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) - were established in 1994 to take over the government-directed spending functions of the four state-owned commercial banks (ICBC, CCB, BOC and ABC). These banks are responsible for financing economic and trade development and state-invested projects. CDB specializes in infrastructure financing; ADBC provides funds for agricultural development projects in rural areas, and EXIM specializes in trade financing. The policy banks like EXIM are able to provide preferential loans with very flexible payment schedules at less than half the interest offered by any of the commercial banks. However, in the last decade the government has steered the policy banks in a new direction and put in motion a dramatic commercialization movement.

	4. Second Tier Joint-Stock Commercial Banks

The second-tier joint-stock commercial banks include CITIC Bank, China Everbright Bank, Hua Xia Bank, China Minsheng Bank, Guangdong Development Bank, Shenzhen Development Bank, China Merchants Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Industrial Bank, Evergrowing Bank, Zheshang Bank and the Bohai Bank. Since 2010, the joint-stock commercial banks in China have witnessed remarkable improvement in asset quality, risk control, profitability and managerial system through constant reform and development.

	5. City Commercial Banks

There are altogether 147 city commercial banks in China, including the Bank of Shanghai, Bank of Beijing, Tianjin City Commercial Bank, Shenzhen City Commercial Bank, Guangzhou City Commercial Bank, Jinan City Commercial Bank, Hangzhou City Commercial Bank, Nanjing City Commercial Bank, Ningbo City Commercial Bank, Wuxi City Commercial Bank, Wuhan City Commercial Bank and Xian City Commercial Bank etc. The Banks of Beijing and Shanghai are the largest city commercial banks.

According to latest statistics from the CBRC, by the end of 2010, the size of deposits and loans in city commercial banks reached RMB 6.1 trillion and RMB 3.6 trillion respectively, of which loans of small- and medium-enterprises comprise RMB 1.1 trillion. By the end of 2010, the outstanding non-performance loans of city commercial banks are RMB 32.56 billion, a drop of RMB 5.13 billion compared with the beginning of the year; the NPL ratio is 0.9 percent, 0.4 percentage points lower than the year beginning; the average capital adequacy ratio is 12.8 percent; liquidity ratio is generally in good situation and the leverage ratio is under control.

	6. Rural Commercial Banks and Rural Credit Cooperatives

Rural credit cooperatives, much closer to rural areas and farmers than any other banking institutions, have created large numbers of financial products which met the needs of rural economy and gained popularity among farmers. In the past 60 years, rural credit cooperative workers have been dedicated to serving agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. Nearly 80,000 branches, with 800,000 workers in counties and rural areas, served 0.8 billion rural residents, provided almost 80 percent of rural household loans and provided 80 percent financial coverage of the under-banked villages and towns in China.

In early 2011, the CBRC selected first five Rural Commercial Banks, i.e., Beijing Rural Commercial Bank, Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank, Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank, Chengdu Rural Commercial Bank, Zhangjiagang Rural Commercial Bank, to carry out the implementation of Basel II pilot. In July 2011, CBRC issued a "Rural Banking Institutions on the Implementation of Basel II Guidance." The implementation of Basel-oriented comprehensive risk management system for rural commercial banks is aimed at narrowing their gap with the other commercial banks, and to enhance their management level and the core competitiveness and to achieve sustainable development.

	7. Foreign Banks in China

At present, the scope of business and regulatory standards for foreign banks registered in China is consistent with that for the Chinese banks. A foreign bank registered in China can operate the foreign exchange and RMB business to enterprises and individuals, and comply with the same requirements as for a Chinese bank in terms of capital adequacy, credit concentration limits, savings and loan ratio, liquidity and other prudential provisions. Branches of foreign banks can conduct foreign exchange business and limited RMB business (only for foreigners in China); those foreign bank branches in China that were approved to conduct RMB business can absorb no less than RMB 100 million from the Chinese citizen for each deposit.

As of the end of September 2011, there were 39 foreign banks locally incorporated in China (consists of 247 branches and subsidiaries), 1 foreign financial company, 93 foreign bank branches and 207 representative offices, from 47 different countries. Over the past decade, the annual compound growth rate of foreign banks reached 19 percent, and the annual compound growth rate of their profits reached 26 percent.

The top five locally incorporated foreign banks' assets all exceed of RMB100 billion, which reach the level of national joint-stock commercial banks. To become a locally incorporated bank in China, a foreign bank needs to apply to the Chinese Banking Regulatory Commission, as well as gain approval from SAFE to bring working capital onshore. The process of doing so is frequently lengthy.
