    "summary": "The primary importer of rice in Iraq is the Ministry of Trade, which must supplement domestic production with imported rice to meet the needs of the Public Distribution System. On average, 90 to 95 percent of rice consumption is imported. Ministry of trade imports about 1400 TMT to meet the needs of Public Distribution System. In 2011, the Ministry has been purchasing lower quality rice, which has increased private sector imports from origins other than the United States. Demand for higher quality rice is increasing and private sector imports hold considerable potential for growth in coming years.",
