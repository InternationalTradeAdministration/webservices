    "summary": "Brazil is a growing market for technical textiles with emphasis on the nonwovens sector. ITA expects the Brazilian nonwovens market to lead the region and grow by 8-9 percent this year and next. Substantial and intensifying trade barriers, however, could hamper U.S. producers' ability to realize true market potential in Brazil.",

    "atom": "Brazil is a large, high-growth market that offers U.S. exporters tremendous opportunities. This large, advanced developing country has experienced rapid GDP growth rates and has rebounded most quickly from the global economic crisis. Given Brazil’s attractiveness as a growth market, foreign competition in Brazil is intense. All major competitors are now fully committed to this market. The stakes are raised by the fact that this is also a difficult market for U.S. companies to navigate. In addition to the cultural and bureaucratic differences, U.S. companies attempting to do business in Brazil too often encounter market access barriers. To address these challenges, the United States needs to focus attention on reducing these barriers to trade through continued commercial dialogues with Brazil. This will be vital for U.S. exporters to expand their reach in the Brazilian textile markets. The Brazilian textile industry is constantly growing owing to the acquisition of modern equipment and technical development applied to production, and also the promotion of its professionals through training programs and increasing productivity. This development program has already received more than $8 billion. The program’s objective is to strengthen Brazil's textile industry in the globalized and competitive market. Brazil is intensely investing in domestic production, with the goal of the textile sector to expand its operations. To achieve such aims, new investments in technology will be essential. At the same time, Brazil would like to increase its textile trade relationship with the United States but due to the trade barriers to foreign imports, exporting to Brazil can be difficult. Nonetheless, U.S. textiles are still going to Brazil in increased quantities year over year. Overview of the Technical Textile Market Brazil is among the top ten textile industry markets worldwide. Brazil’s textile and apparel sector is the second largest employer in the country. The technical textile industry in a key export driven country such as Brazil continues to rapidly develop with investment from both domestic and foreign multinational companies. The technical textile sector has over 200 companies currently operating in Brazil, employing roughly 40,000 people. Technical textiles and nonwovens are two sectors which have found an increasingly greater number of applications in recent years in Brazil. The local market is developing at a fast pace, and many local textile manufacturers are now concentrating on this type of production. U.S. exporters have been taking advantage of this growth by increasing exports to Brazil 65 percent from 2008 to 2014. Additionally, exports of nonwovens increased 17 percent annually over this six year period. The technical textile market expected to grow the fastest include disposable nonwovens with end use applications such as air and liquid filtration at 9.4 percent, absorbent hygiene at 8.4 percent, and wipes 7 percent. Within the durables market the only technical textile near the growth of the disposables is in the automotive market.",
