  :atom: 'Interview By Roza Pace, Trade Specialist, U.S. Department of Commerce Q:
    Why Should U.S Academic Institutions Pursue International Student Recruitment
    As you can see from the above introduction, the economic benefits are great, in
    the billions of dollars. NAFSA (NAFSA.org) conducts an annual state-by-state and
    congressional district analysis of the economic contributions of international
    students and their families to the U.S. economy. Enhancing networking opportunities
    and sharing our ideals are additional benefits. Polish students are definitely
    part of this mix. Attracting international students helps U.S. schools increase
    their international ranking. The mark of a top university is its ability to be
    a major player in the international education market and its ability to attract
    international students. Additional benefits for universities to name a few, include
    internationalizing college experience, making U.S. college graduates better acquainted
    with global trends, improving foreign language acquisition, and helping US students
    to understand the world better. Q: What makes the United States an attractive
    destination for foreign students? The U.S. educational system at the college level
    offers unparalleled experiences for international students. Fourteen of the top
    twenty universities in the world are located in the United States. According to
    the Institute of International Education, there are more international students
    studying at American institutions than anywhere else in the world. Students from
    Eastern Europe represent only a fraction (less than 5 per cent) of all students
    that come to the United States from Europe. The combination of world-class education
    and opportunity to connect with the world in one place of study is truly a unique
    experience that is hard to find anywhere else in the world. Q: Why should U.S.
    academic institutions look at recruiting Polish students? The number of Polish
    Students enrolled in non-degree programs in the United States has increased by
    28 per cent since 2010/11 academic year. The U.S. and Poland share a long history
    of supporting democratic principles and values. Poles also admire America for
    its political strength and scientific achievements which can be, in large part,
    attributed to the education system. American universities, governments, and businesses
    have been conducting scientific exchanges and cooperating on innovation and technology
    advancements. Increasing the number of Polish students pursuing degrees in the
    U.S. will build on the important advances that have already been made in education.
    Polish students being members of European community do have access to excellent
    education in the region and Polish graduates will doubtfully become business and
    political leaders in Europe. While European education is much less expensive for
    Polish students, U.S. universities are attractive as they have a wider international
    outlook and generally include a more diverse international student body. Even
    a college with a mostly domestic population will often have a multi-cultural student
    body, offering the student a diverse learning environment. Some key highlights
    on the significance of the Polish student market: • Poland is a prime target for
    U.S. educational institutions from which they can successfully recruit both undergraduate
    and graduate students. The Polish market represents the sixth largest country
    in the European Union in terms of population, but also, from a demographic standpoint.
    • The academic and cultural value that these students contribute to American universities
    is significant however these students also bring a great deal of financial clout
    to American campuses and local communities. • Poland is a prime target from which
    U.S. educational institutions can successfully recruit both undergraduate and
    graduate students. This market not only represents the sixth largest country in
    the European Union in terms of population, but also, from a demographic standpoint.
    • According to Daniel Kantowski, an educational consultant in Poland, the EU has
    almost 4,000 higher education institutions with 434 of them in Poland. With only
    7% of EU population, Poland accounts for some 11% institutions of higher education
    with only about a 100 are public. • In 2014/2015 344,000 Polish students were
    admitted to higher level learning institutes of which 75.6% students were enrolled
    in public schools. Q: What are some additional benefits from recruiting in Poland
    or elsewhere in Central Europe? • Diversify international student populations
    • Avoid reliance on only a few countries for international students • Create an
    international programs division • Use international education and exchange as
    a powerful tool Q: What are some of the most popular universities for Polish students?
    University of Chicago, the University of Virginia, New York University Harvard,
    Rutgers University and Columbia are some of the most popular ones. There are many
    other universities that Polish students choose however the overall number of Polish
    students studying there are small. While many elite Polish students are interested
    in top universities in the United States, they may be able to find excellent educational
    experiences in smaller or less known universities as well as community colleges,
    for example, other places such as Lewis and Clark College or University of South
    Florida. Some of these colleges offer a limited number of scholarships to international
    students. Q: Can you share specific examples of success stories such as prominent
    Poles politicians, artists, actors, businessmen, engineers, athletes or entrepreneurs
    educated in the United States? There are countless examples of Polish students
    and professionals who, after studying in the U.S., have returned to invest in
    the Polish economy. These include experts in high technology, engineering, business,
    finance, medicine, law, and more. Several senior government officials studied
    in the U.S. Two examples of Polish high ranking government officials studying
    in the US are: (FYI, the new government was established in mid-November 2015):
    • Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Development: Central
    Connecticut State University. Uzyskał dyplom MBA na Akademii Ekonomicznej we Wrocławiu.
    est także absolwentem Uniwersytetu w Hamburgu, Uniwersytetu w Bazylei oraz Kellog
    School of Management Uniwersytetu Northwestern, Evanston w Stanach Zjednoczonych.
    • Paweł Szałamacha, Minister of Finance: graduate of Law and Administration Department
    at Adama Mickiewicz University in Poznan and a College d''Europe w Brugii, completed
    studies at John F. Kennedy School of Government Uniwersytetu at Harvard, where
    he graduated with Master in Public Administration (Mid-Career MPA), specializing
    in organization and management. • Many CEOs of Polish firms studied or have a
    strong affiliation with U.S. universities. For example, Bogusława Skowrońska is
    the owner and co-founder of Capital Solutions proAlfa Sp. z o.o., and serves as
    a certified advisor on the NewConnect segment of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. She
    graduated from Harvard University (MBA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
    Through her outreach and alumni connections, Ms. Skowrońska has helped encourage
    many Polish students to study in the United States. The chart below covers a number
    of options students from Poland should consider, especially with some of the options
    being more competitively priced than others. U.S. Department of Commerce, International
    Trade Administration, U.S. Commercial Service What are some specific challenges
    prospective students from Poland may face? • cost of studies compared with average
    income in Poland, • current exchange rates that reflect a strong dollar • the
    lack of a visa waiver program • financing The availability of scholarships both
    from Polish Institutions and from American ones may help overcome some of these
    challenges. Where a student cannot pay full fare, merit scholarships for most
    competitive students may bring non-monetary value to a university. While financial
    aid is not available for international students, some universities like Jacksonville
    University offer merit scholarships based on recalculated GPA. International students
    who need additional financial assistance may also work on campus for up to 20
    hours each week. Q: What type of visa student would need to study in the United
    States? International students are granted a J-1 cultural exchange visa to study
    in the United States and they may be required to return to their home country
    at the completion of the scholarship to share their experience with their fellow
    students and countrymen. Additional visa information may be obtained at: http://travel.state.gov
    from the United States Department of State website. U.S. Department of Commerce,
    International Trade Administration, U.S. Commercial Service Resources page Potential
    resources Polish students may consider when applying to study in the US: U.S.
    colleges offer little aid to foreign undergraduate students unless they happen
    to be talented athletes or winners of major international science competitions.
    However, a number of places offer scholarships or have special programs to help
    foreign students, especially top international students with high grades and strong
    leadership capabilities. Individual schools are more likely to offer grants and
    scholarships for international students/foreign students who prove themselves
    superior in their fields of study. It may be a bit easier to secure financial
    aid while in graduate school as graduate and teaching assistantships and fellowships
    are offered to students with proven academic records, regardless of whether they
    are foreign students / international students or US citizens. However, some schools
    will not consider students for fellowships or assistantships until their second
    year of study. There is financial aid available for international students/foreign
    students to study in the US, but it takes great initiative and a strong determination
    to secure it. Information on student scholarship opportunities, including international
    students/foreign students studying in the United States: UNIGO (www.unigo.com)
    includes a database of scholarships for international students. This is a service
    of financial aid professionals, who find the most appropriate scholarships for
    an individual student’s situation. The company prides itself on saving you time
    by having the most up-to-date listing of awards, which are reviewed annually.
    For MBA graduate international students, Unigo can offer some student loans without
    U.S. co-signers. Financial Aid for Undergraduate International Students (NAFSA
    NAFSA.org) provides tips and lists sources of additional information. International
    Education Financial Aid Website allows international students to search for scholarships
    based on their field of study. Rotary International Scholarships. Mostly domestic
    opportunities but some for foreign students. http://us.fulbrightonline.org/ and
    http://www.fulbright.edu.pl/en/home/ Fulbright programs (graduate studies) Also,
    some international agencies such as the United Nations and the World Council of
    Churches offer financial aid for international students who wish to study in the
    United States. It is also recommended for students to check US Educational Advising
    Centers in their country: Study in USA for resources and organizations in their
    own country that can provide guidance with financial aid and scholarships. Note:
    Students may try researching grants or loans in their own country for study abroad.
    What interests them? What clubs, churches, or civic groups are they a member of?
    It is certainly worth the time to research groups in one’s own country that may
    offer college scholarships to individuals with particular interests, ideals, or
    ethnic background. Additional resources on scholarship opportunities for international
