  :topic: Minimum Import Prices
  :industry: 
  :content: 'In May 2001, the Government of Argentina (GOA) introduced minimum import
    prices/reference values on several products covered by specific HS codes to avoid
    under-invoicing. When the minimum import price is greater than the declared value
    at Customs, the importer must make a deposit for taxes due on the price differential
    to take merchandise out of customs. This deposit will be held during the period
    of investigation on the real or market import price. These minimum import prices
    apply when goods are imported for consumption. In 2005, in an attempt to continue
    adjusting mechanisms against tax evasion in import operations, the GOA issued
    Secretariat of Industry Resolutions 1907 and 1908. These regulations created a
    new system to determine “reference import values” (valores criterio) for products
    to be compared with the value declared at Customs by the importer, and impose
    stricter conditions to import when the declared unitary FOB value represents less
    than 80 percent of the reference value. In these cases, the import process will
    continue, but the importer will bear additional restrictions such as: • Increase
    on Valued Added Tax (VAT) and Income Tax paid on imports, reaching rates of 21
    percent and 11 percent respectively, depending on the product type. • Loss of
    tax benefits such as exemption or deferment of VAT and Income Tax payments. •
    Deposit of a guarantee equivalent of the difference between the reference value
    and the declared value. Deposit/guarantee policies are no longer accepted for
    these cases. Only cash, bank collaterals, or public debt bonds will serve as a
    guarantee to allow the import transaction. Several subsequent regulations have
    continued to update and expand the list of minimum/reference prices. In 2008,
    Customs Notes 90 and 91 required importers of any goods from designated countries
    that are invoiced below the reference prices to have the invoice validated by
    both the foreign customs agency and the appropriate Argentine Embassy or Consulate.
    U.S. products with reference prices include: • Matches • Other plates, sheets,
    film, foil and strip, of plastics, non-cellular and not reinforced, laminated,
    supported or similarly combined with other materials: of poly (methyl methacrylate),
    not over 25mm or over 105mm in thickness • Rubber bicycle tubes • Wooden hangers
    • Non-rewritable compact discs (CD-R) • Fungicides • Electrical terminals • Low
    density polyethylene • Cermet manufactures • Fiberglass tissue • Iron and Steel
    tubes • Tires (new) • Refrigerators • Washing machines At the same time, the Argentine
    Customs Bureau announced that there would be specific Customs checkpoints that
    will control imports of certain product categories such as household appliances,
    electronic devices, motorcycles, textiles, apparel, footwear and toys. These items
    are traditionally the most affected by import restrictions.'

  :topic: Tariff Barriers
  :industry: 
  :content: 'MERCOSUR, created in 1991, gradually eliminated almost all non-tariff
    restrictions and other limitations to trade among its founding members (Argentina,
    Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). As of 2006, over 99 percent of all MERCOSUR tariff
    lines had been reduced to zero. Sugar has not yet been incorporated into MERCOSUR’s
    internal free trade regime, and certain other products such as autos and auto
    parts, while officially incorporated, are actively managed, including by the use
    of quantitative restrictions (quotas). For countries outside the MERCOSUR area,
    Argentina and its MERCOSUR partners established the MERCOSUR Common External Tariff
    (CET) on January 1, 1995. The CET currently ranges from zero to 20 percent for
    most products. However, some products in the automotive sector can reach 35 percent.
    There is a list of sensitive products temporarily exempted from the CET. The first
    group includes very sensitive products such as Information Technology and Capital
    Goods. At the same time, the MERCOSUR countries can set an import duty different
    from the CET until December 31, 2015 for specific products, using the so-called
    Exceptions List (pursuant to Decision 58/10 CMC MERCOSUR). Starting in July 2012,
    imported capital goods that compete against local production have been subject
    to a 14 percent tariff. Imported capital goods that don''t have a local substitute
    face a 2 percent tariff. Information and telecommunications-related (IT) products
    are regulated by a separate tariff schedule, which expires on December 31, 2015.
    After this date, all import duties will begin to converge among MERCOSUR members
    according to a fixed schedule. Some goods not produced within MERCOSUR, such as
    newsprint, books, and certain petroleum products, pay 0 to 16 percent import duties.
    The tariffs on imports apply to the declared CIF value in Argentina. In addition
    to the tariffs, the following fees and taxes apply: • 0.5 percent statistics fee
    on the CIF value, with some exceptions. This fee is not levied on MERCOSUR intra-zone
    trade. • 21 or 10.5 percent (depending on the product) of Value Added Tax (VAT)
    on the CIF value plus tariff and statistics fees. • 20 or 10 percent (depending
    on the product) of advanced VAT on CIF plus tariff and statistics fees on all
    goods imported for resale. Goods imported directly by end-users are exempted.
    • Six percent profits tax on all retail goods, except for goods imported directly
    by users. Individuals pay 11 percent. • 1.5 percent gross income tax The CIF value
    plus the duty and the import statistics fee form the base for the application
    of domestic taxes. For this reason, foreign supplier''s invoice must support the
    imports. VAT and Profits Tax are deductible from gross income tax. Domestic taxes
    (i.e., excise taxes) are levied on tobacco, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks,
    syrups, extracts and concentrates, television sets, tape recorders, record players,
    and microwave appliances, among other products. Excise taxes are paid on the basis
    of sworn returns or through stamps affixed to the product. Rates vary considerably,
    reaching up to 60 percent of the retail price for cigarettes. Decree 690/2002
    specifies exceptions to the payment of the statistics fee, which include: • Certain
    imported goods for animal or vegetable reproduction, which pay a zero percent
    CET. • Certain imported mineral products that pay zero percent CET. • Imported
    books, brochures, and newsprint. • New imported capital and IT-related goods.
    • Goods imported under the temporary import regime. The following offices are

  :topic: Standards Overview
  :industry: 
  :content: 'A 1994 decree created the legal framework (Decree 1474/94) for standards-related
    activities in Argentina. As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Argentina
    signed the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), affirming its obligations
    relative to technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures. The Argentine
    Standards Institute (IRAM) has signed the WTO TBT Code of Good Practice for the
    Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards. Responsibilities under the
    TBT agreement include the establishment of a national inquiry point to serve as
    a central location for information on standards-related issues, including proposed
    mandatory regulations. The Argentine inquiry point is in the Secretariat of Industry
    (see Information Sources below). The U.S. inquiry point is the National Center
    for Standards and Certification Information (NCSCI), located at National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (see Information Sources below). Standards and Regulations
    in MERCOSUR Argentina, as an active MERCOSUR member, participates in the development
    of MERCOSUR standards and regulations. The MERCOSUR Standards Association, Asociación
    MERCOSUR de Normalización, previously known as the Comité MERCOSUR de Normalización
    (AMN) ― composed of the standards institutes of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and
    Uruguay ― develops and harmonizes standards. The Executive Secretariat of the
    AMN is located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Voluntary standards are developed in 16 technical
    committees and deal mostly with steel products, cement and concrete, and electrical
    safety. Several hundred standards are at different stages of preparation or in
    the work plan. Venezuela will participate in this activity, as well, as a full
    member of MERCOSUR. Regional technical regulations are developed and/or harmonized
    by the MERCOSUR governments in Sub Working Group 3 in the following fields: automotive,
    foods, metrology, safety issues for electrical products, toys, and pre-measured
    products. Separate working groups, such as those on telecommunications and health
    issues, also focus on mandatory technical requirements for their particular sectors.
    Approved MERCOSUR regulations are not automatically applicable in each country.
    To be applicable, harmonized MERCOSUR regulations must be adopted by each country.
    The four countries generally adopt all MERCOSUR regulations, though at different
    speeds. Agricultural and Health-related Products Please note that agricultural
    and health-related products are subject to specific and different voluntary standards
    and mandatory technical regulations. Medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and foods
    are the purview of ANMAT.'

  :topic: Business Customs
  :industry: 
  :content: U.S. businesspeople should take the time to develop a close personal relationship
    with their agent, representative, distributor, or other business partner. Argentine
    business customs are generally more formal than those in the United States. Business
    dress, appearance, and general demeanor are more conservative. Courtesy is very
    important, and efforts to rush a business deal are likely to be unsuccessful.
    No encounter starts with a business discussion. To develop a solid business relationship
    and establish trust it is important to devote some time to discussing family members,
    sports, and social activities. At meetings it is important to shake hands with
    everyone in the room upon arrival and departure. Among Argentines it is customary
    for men to kiss women they meet for the first time on the right cheek. However,
    Americans should shake hands with Argentine women until a friendly relationship
    has been established. Contacts and introductions are important and therefore,
    it is advisable to use the services of the U.S. Commercial Service at the U.S.
    Embassy in Buenos Aires, or other organizations such as the American Chamber of
    Commerce, industry associations, and other intermediaries, rather than rely on
    a direct "cold call" approach. The U.S. Commercial Service in Argentina offers
    a complete package for the businessperson to meet with potential business partners.
    It is important that you arrive promptly to business meetings, though your Argentine
    contact may be slightly late, and to always have a pre-arranged appointment. Be
    sure to have an ample supply of business cards. Although not essential, it is
    beneficial to have cards printed in Spanish as well as English. One cultural note
    is that it is not good form to say you are from "America." In Latin America, the
    term "America" denotes both North and South America, not just the United States.
    Therefore, it is better to call yourself a “North American” (norteamericano).

    Resources Market Estimates Overview The food and beverage (F&B) industry is one
    of the main industries contributing to the Argentine economy, accounting for 33
    percent of Argentina’s total exports. Some of its main trends are as follows:
    1. significant investments in technology updates; 2. local production capacity
    being fully used, which requires additional investments to supply the growing
    food demand; 3. “Health and Nutrition” considered a strong concept in the F&B
    business; 4. greater interaction between the local industry and universities,
    fostering innovation. The main ingredients imported were those that are not manufactured
    locally or their production is not sufficient to supply the local industry. There
    is a significant market for some U.S. food ingredients among local producers of
    ingredients, who use them to manufacture high-value, tailor-made food products.
    However, Argentine F&B imports for 2013 are projected to slightly decline, as
    a result of the slowdown of the country’s economy, and the trade restrictive measures
    taken by the government of Argentina (GOA) which are adversely affecting imports.
    The GOA is expected to continue to closely monitor imports as a means of trying
    to maintain a surplus trade balance by restricting imports and promoting exports.

    of existing networks enjoyed by their agents and distributors and expand their
    business through such contacts. Trading Companies China''s current regulations
    are designed to allow manufacturing-focused foreign invested enterprises (FIEs)
    to become export trading companies that may purchase and export any products or
    technologies free from quotas, license controls or government monopoly. FIEs are
    able to establish trading companies and to obtain trading rights before the phase-in
    of distribution rights. Chinese companies that are registered and have RMB 1 million
    (US$148,000) in capitalization can obtain an import/export license. In 2005, the
    Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) issued documents outlining the application procedures
    for investors to establish new foreign-invested commercial enterprises (FICEs),
    for existing FICEs to open new distribution and trading businesses, and for existing
    FIEs to expand their business scope. The documents give provincial-level agencies
    the authority to review and approve applications. Approval for new foreign enterprises
    occurs at the provincial level, and not the national level. In 2006, MOFCOM issued
    a notice on "Entrusting Local Authorities with the Examination and Approval of
    Commercial Enterprises with Foreign Investment." While this decision to delegate
    approval authority to provincial-level authorities for most distribution rights
    has sped up the application process, technical challenges still remain. Existing
    foreign-invested manufacturers that have expanded their business scope are limited
    to distributing goods that they produce. Uncertainty over what constitutes "similar
    goods" has created difficulties for some companies seeking to exercise their distribution
    rights. In addition, existing manufacturers that have expanded their business
    scope to include distribution must ensure that half of their revenue stems from
    their buy-sell activity. Distributors A U.S. exporting company that hopes to successfully
    enter China must gain both trading and distribution rights. Distribution covers:
    1) commission agent services, 2) wholesale services, and 3) retailing. Chinese
    law allows foreign companies to establish wholly-owned distribution entities for
    chemical fertilizers, processed oil and crude oil, as well as other imported and
    domestically produced products. Limits exist on products including books and periodicals,
    pharmaceutical products and pesticides. Foreign companies may choose one of two
    ways to acquire trading and distribution rights: they can set up a new, stand-alone
    FICE or apply to expand the business scope of an existing FIE. Given the complexities
    of the Chinese market, foreign companies should also consider using a domestic
    Chinese agent for both importing into China and marketing within China. With careful
    selection, training, and constant contact, a U.S. exporter can obtain good market
    representation from a Chinese trading company, many of which are authorized to
    deal in a wide range of products. Some of the larger companies have offices in
    the U.S. and other countries around the world, as well as a network of offices
    and affiliates in China. Local Agents China has many local sales agents who handle
    internal distribution and marketing. Most of these firms do not have import/export
    authorization. They are the next layer down the distribution chain, buying foreign
    products and importing them through import/export licensees. These sales agents
    then pay a commission to the licensee. They may be representative offices of Hong
    Kong-based or other foreign trading companies, or domestic Chinese firms with
    regional or partial national networks.'

  :content: 'Aircraft Parts: Manufacture and Repair China''s import market for aircraft
    parts and components exceeded $1.6 billion in 2010, an increase of over 23.5 percent
    compared with last year. China''s demand for aircraft parts can be attributed
    to a number of factors including an increasing capacity utilization rate, the
    age and expansion of China''s aircraft fleet, and the domestic production and
    assembly of aircraft. There are 1,745 registered commercial transport aircraft
    in China with an average age of five years, and as the fleet continues to age,
    it will require parts and equipment for routine maintenance and repair. Though
    there are a number of major domestic aircraft and parts manufacturers scattered
    throughout China, the sector is still underdeveloped, creating a strong demand
    for reliable imported products and technologies to ensure quality standards. China''s
    domestic aircraft part and assembly manufacturing sector is also growing. In addition
    to approximately 200 small aircraft parts manufacturers, there are also a number
    of regionally-based major manufacturers concentrated in Shanghai, Chengdu, Xi''an,
    Jiangxi and Shenyang. China''s domestic manufacturing base is developing, as reflected
    by the commitments of large aircraft and engine manufactures to expand procurement
    in China over the long term. However, most highly technical and sophisticated
    parts and assemblies will continue to be imported until production quality meets
    international standards. At the present time, domestic manufacturers do not have
    the ability to produce all of the qualified materials and parts. Airports China
    currently has 180 civil aviation airports, including the world''s second busiest
    in Beijing, with plans to expand aggressively to 244 by 2020. The government announced
    plans to invest $64 billion to build and improve 97 airports by 2021, including
    78 green field projects. The expansion will place 80 percent of China''s population
    and 96 percent of its GDP within 100 kilometers of the nearest airport, greatly
    enhancing the potential for aviation growth. The airport system at present is
    highly concentrated, with top airports suffering from major congestion. The top
    three airports located in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou account for 1/3 of all
    traffic, while the top 14 airports handle 2/3 of total traffic nationwide. Local
    industry estimates indicate that 40 of China''s airports are already at or near
    capacity, with another 29 expected to reach this limit within the next two years.
    To relieve congestion, China opened 19 new airports over a three-year period from
    2009-2011. Construction of the long-awaited second airport in Beijing could begin
    in 2012. The airport is expected to be built in the southern part of China''s
    capital, with an expected capacity of 100 million passengers a year. The bidding
    process of Terminal Area Designing was completed at the end of 2011. International
    companies will have opportunities to participate in both airport design and infrastructure
    construction. Qualified companies may be approved to compete with domestic companies
    via a bidding process for design, consultation, surveillance, management, and
    construction of designated civil airport projects. So far, Beijing Capital Airport,
    Shanghai Pudong Airport, Shanghai Hongqiao Airport, Shenzhen Huangtian Airport,
    and Guangzhou''s new Baiyun Airport have all been designed by international companies.
    Ground service is another area in which foreign companies can actively participate.
    Beijing Capital Airport, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport, and Chengdu Shuangliu Airport
    have all established joint ventures with foreign partners (Singapore, Indonesia
    and UK) in ground services. Shanghai Airport Ground cooperated with Cargo Warehouse
    and Lufthansa set up a joint venture. China Air Oil Supply Corporation (CAOSC)
    has established many joint ventures with foreign companies to provide air oil
    supply services. General Aviation General Aviation (GA) remains an underdeveloped
    part of China''s aviation industry, but it is poised for growth. Local industry
    contacts estimate that China has about 1,000 GA aircraft, compared with more than
    220,000 in the United States, including only about 100 large business jets. Yet
    the number of total GA flight hours in 2011 grew 16 percent to 455,000, clearly
    indicating the industry''s growth potential. Strict military control over roughly
    70 percent of all Chinese airspace is the single largest factor limiting growth
    of this industry. A welcome change came in November 2010 when civilian and military
    authorities issued a joint reform document calling for liberalization of low altitude
    airspace under 4,000 meters (13,000 feet). Implementation of the reform will roll
    out in three stages, starting with an Experimental Phase in Guangzhou and Shenyang.
    The policy outlines a national rollout by 2015, and a final deepening and consolidation
    by 2020. While the details remain vague, this policy shift indicates clear support
    for GA and should have large and positive impacts on the sector. Market potential
    is vast. In the southern province of Guangdong alone (one of the two pilot areas),
    market demand is estimated at 200-250 aircraft worth $1-1.25 billion.'

  :topic: Air Pollution Control Equipment - Overview
  :industry: Air Pollution Control Equipment
  :content: 'Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges to public
    health facing China today. The major source of air pollutants in Chinese cities
    has gradually shifted from conventional coal combustion to a mixture of coal combustion
    and motor vehicle emissions. Common waste gas emissions are primarily composed
    of four main pollutants- SO2, soot, industrial dust and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx).
    Although emission trends have shown improvement in recent years, in 2010 the total
    SO2 discharge in China was still 21.85 million tons and total NOx emissions, monitored
    since 2006, had risen by 9.4 percent over the previous year. (See chart below)
    Source: “2011 Report on the State of the Environment in China,” released by the
    Ministry of Environment in June 2011 In response to these trends, the Chinese
    Government has focused some policy and regulatory attention on measures aimed
    at mitigating the emissions of dangerous nitrous oxides, with one such example
    being the Ministry of Environmental Protection''s "Notice of Fossil-Fuel Fired
    Power Plant Nitrogen Oxide Emission Prevention and Treatment Policy," issued on
    January 27, 2010. This official government policy has established the framework
    by which NOx emissions reduction actions will be taken under the 12th 5YP, which
    took effect on January 1, 2011. The policy applies to all coal-fired power plants
    and co-generation units, 200 MW or larger, except in designated "Focus Areas,"
    where it applies to all units regardless of size. In addition, it is mandatory
    that all new, rebuilt, or retrofitted units that have undergone expansion install
    Low- NOx Combustion Technologies. All units currently in operation, within their
    scheduled operating life cycles, that do not meet stipulated NOx emission standards
    are required to install flue gas de-NOx technology. Another notable measure put
    forth by the Chinese Government in 2011 is the revision of China''s Ambient Air
    Quality Standards. In late 2011, China released a revised version of the standards
    for public opinion soliciting, which for the first time includes monitoring of
    PM 2.5 in the monitoring of ambient air quality. These standards are scheduled
    to be released in early 2012, with compulsory enforcement beginning in 2016. These
    new standards have triggered a tremendous round of equipment purchases throughout
    China, bringing about huge market opportunities for producers of PM2.5 monitoring
    equipment. China''s 12th 5YP (2011-2015) is further strengthening the monitoring
    market. In his speech at the 2009 Conference on China Environmental Monitoring
    Work, Vice Minister Wu Xiaoqing outlined the top priorities of environmental monitoring
    work for the 12th 5YP. Given these priorities, U.S. air monitoring equipment suppliers
    should focus on the following market opportunities in China from 2011-2015: Expand
    existing monitoring networks to rural areas. Increase monitoring capacity to achieve
    total volume monitoring of pollutants. Establish an environmental monitoring information
    platform for publishing and releasing relevant information. The various plans
    and regulations mentioned above will invariably trigger commercial opportunities
    in the air pollution market. U.S. firms are facing both domestic and international
    competition, including government-subsidized Japanese and European competitors.
    Though experiencing rapid growth, the domestic industry is still in a nascent
    stage of development, due to its short development history, decentralized management,
    inadequate financing and poor enforcement. U.S. air quality monitoring equipment
    is well received, and is often considered high-quality in terms of data accuracy,
    timeliness and product lifecycle. In order to seize these emerging opportunities,
    U.S. companies should develop suitable market entry and pricing strategies.'

  :content: 'Semiconductors The 12th FYP included support incentives for IC and Light
    Emitting Diode (LED) manufacturers. Most new fabrication plants built in China
    receive subsidies or other support from local governments, and as a result many
    foreign companies are establishing fabrication facilities in China. Between 2008
    and 2010 foreign companies invested in forty-six percent of new LED fabrication
    facilities. Possibly because of increased foreign investment into production capacity
    in China, the US saw a 19.43% drop in the value of semiconductor exports to China
    in 2011. China has experienced overall growth in the semiconductor industry, but
    mostly manufactures low and mid-range semiconductors. Equipment necessary for
    manufacturing wafers and LEDs are mostly imported from abroad. Increased foreign
    investment in wafer and LED fabs in China should increase demand for high-end
    semiconductor manufacturing technology. Software China''s software industry remains
    a key focus for the nation''s central government, with incentives for both domestic
    growth and foreign investment. At present, the market remains diverse and highly
    fragmented, with over 16,000 locally-certified software companies, approximately
    40,000 registered software products, and more than one million software-industry
    professionals. Over the next few years, the industry is expected to experience
    more consolidation. Overall, China''s software industry still lacks core technologies,
    high-end software development talent, and consistent high quality software products.
    Moreover, foreign brands enjoy a large market share in the high-end segment of
    the software market, with local software products comprising less than 30 percent
    of the market. Although packaged software imports from the US continue to rise,
    the best prospects for US firms are for high-end software solutions requiring
    a certain level of customization. As an indication of the rapidly changing marketplace
    and delivery methods such as cloud services, the true size of China''s software
    market is unknown. The preceding table includes only packaged units tracked on
    Global Trade Atlas and UN Comtrade. Other entities, such as MIIT, estimate that
    China''s software market grew to over $290 billion in 2011. Best prospects for
    2012 include: Application software and specialty software Solutions pertaining
    to enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM),
    service-oriented architecture (SOA), middleware, and open-source software will
    have good prospects in the China market. High-end enterprise management systems
    software Solutions that address database management systems, systems management
    software products, and networking security software products remain some of the
    fastest growing areas for foreign firms selling in the China marketplace. Specialty
    software Customized software targeted for a specific industry or market sector
    is a market segment in which foreign firms have an estimated 70 percent of the
    market. U.S. firms hold a strong position in such areas as firmware, as well as
    gaming, automation, digital imaging, storage, and security software. Cloud Computing
    Cloud computing and other cloud services are a recent development in China. China
    has allocated $103 million dollars to help guide the business-led development
    plan, led by indigenous companies like Baidu and Alibaba. Considered a SEI, many
    pilot projects are underway in select cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen,
    Wuxi and Hangzhou. Domestic businesses developing cloud technology in these cities
    can be expected to receive subsidies. Despite the recent investment, cloud computing
    isn''t expected to be applied on a large scale until the 13th FYP, when the industry
    will be worth up to an estimated $156 billion. Current figures value China''s
    cloud industry at $9.63 billion. Recent large, private investments by some of
    China''s major mobile carriers further indicate the importance placed on domestic
    cloud development: China Mobile recently invested $1.9 billion into a cloud datacenter
    located in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. China Mobile''s goal is to use the center to
    assist the roll-out of their 4G network and TD-LTE standard. China Unicom and
    China Telecom have also reportedly invested $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively,
    within Inner Mongolia.'

  :industry: Agriculture
  :content: The United States Department of Agriculture, through the Foreign Agricultural
    Service (FAS), operates six offices in the People's Republic of China for the
    purpose of expanding exports of U.S. agriculture, fishery, and forestry products.
    U.S. agricultural, fishery, and forestry exports to China from January to December
    2011 reached a new high of $21.9 billion, up 13 percent from 2010. China is the
    second-largest U.S. overseas market for agriculture, fish, and forestry exports.
    Given China's rising incomes and demand for raw materials and finished foodstuffs,
    FAS forecasts that China's imports will continue to grow well into the future.
    Exports continue to be dominated by bulk commodities, notably soybeans ($10.5
    billion), cotton ($2.6 billion), and corn ($0.8 billion). However, intermediate
    products exports also did well, with hides and skins reaching a record export
    level of $1.2 billion. Importantly, U.S. exports of consumer-oriented food products,
    which represent high value-added products, also hit a record $2.0 billion of exports
    to China in 2011. In this category, record sales were set for red meats (pork)
    at $0.6 billion, dairy products at $0.4 billion, processed fruits and vegetables
    at $0.2 billion and nuts at $0.2 billion. Wine and beer exports were a record
    $65 million. China's agriculture, fishery and forestry exports to the United States
    during calendar year 2011 were $8.2 billion, up 12 percent from the previous year.
    The United States is China's second-largest overseas market for agriculture, fish
    and forestry exports. Due to the changing regulatory environment in China, U.S.
    exporters are advised to carefully check import regulations. Individuals and enterprises
    interested in exporting U.S. agriculture, fishery, and forestry commodities to
    China should contact the FAS offices (listed below) as well as USDA Cooperator
    organizations. Exporters of U.S. agricultural commodities should also review the
    FAS website (http://www.fas.usda.gov), which features general information about
    trade shows and other promotional venues to showcase agricultural products, FAS-sponsored

  :country: CN
  :section_url: http://govwizely.github.io/ccg/china/how-does-banking-system-operate.html
  :topic: How Does the Banking System Operate
  :industry: 
  :content: 'Banking System in China Cooperation and competition co-exist between
    Chinese banks and foreign banks in China. 1. Regulators: People''s Bank of China
    and China Banking Regulatory Commission Tasked to formulate and implement monetary
    policy, the People''s Bank of China (PBOC) is China''s central bank and reports
    to the State Council. The State Council, however, maintains oversight of the PBOC
    and makes all final decisions on China''s major financial and monetary policy
    issues. According to the 1995 Central Bank Law, the PBOC has full autonomy in
    applying monetary instruments, including setting interest rates for commercial
    banks and trading in government bonds. It maintains the banking sector''s payment,
    clearing and settlement systems, and manages official foreign exchange and gold
    reserves. The PBOC also oversees the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
    (SAFE) in the setting of foreign exchange policies. The China Banking Regulatory
    Commission (CBRC) was launched on April 28, 2003 to improve the efficiency of
    bank supervision and allow the PBOC to further focus on the country''s macro-economic
    and currency policy and to take over the bank supervisory role from the PBOC.
    CBRC is responsible for the regulation and supervision of banks, asset management
    companies, trust and investment companies as well as other deposit-taking financial
    institutions. Its mission is to maintain a safe banking system in China. 2. The
    "Big Five" Chinese Commercial Banks The largest five state-owned banks in China,
    the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Bank of China (BOC), the
    China Construction Bank (CCB), the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), and Bank
    of Communications dominate the banking system and together account for well over
    half of all loans and deposits in China''s banks. Several have become some of
    the largest banks in the world as valued by market capitalization. For example,
    Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Construction Bank are the world''s
    largest and second largest banks by market value. While the State, operating through
    the Ministry of Finance, continues to own a majority stake in each of these institutions.
    These five banks all are publicly listed in Chinese stock markets and also on
    international bourses. The "Big Five" constitute the absolute majority of bank
    lending in China. Bank lending remains the most important financing vehicle in
    the country; equity finance and the corporate bond market remain very small in
    comparison, while bank lending constitutes roughly 80 percent of total lending.
    The majority profits of a Chinese bank comes from the difference between the interest
    rate paid to depositors and the lending rate to the borrowers, which a generous
    spread is set by the central bank in order to protect the banks from fierce competition.
    3. Policy Banks Three "policy" banks-the Agricultural Development Bank of China
    (ADBC), the China Development Bank (CDB), and the Export-Import Bank of China
    (EXIM) - were established in 1994 to take over the government-directed spending
    functions of the four state-owned commercial banks (ICBC, CCB, BOC and ABC). These
    banks are responsible for financing economic and trade development and state-invested
    projects. CDB specializes in infrastructure financing; ADBC provides funds for
    agricultural development projects in rural areas, and EXIM specializes in trade
    financing. The policy banks like EXIM are able to provide preferential loans with
    very flexible payment schedules at less than half the interest offered by any
    of the commercial banks. However, in the last decade the government has steered
    the policy banks in a new direction and put in motion a dramatic commercialization
    movement. 4. Second Tier Joint-Stock Commercial Banks The second-tier joint-stock
    commercial banks include CITIC Bank, China Everbright Bank, Hua Xia Bank, China
    Minsheng Bank, Guangdong Development Bank, Shenzhen Development Bank, China Merchants
    Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Industrial Bank, Evergrowing Bank, Zheshang
    Bank and the Bohai Bank. Since 2010, the joint-stock commercial banks in China
    have witnessed remarkable improvement in asset quality, risk control, profitability
    and managerial system through constant reform and development. 5. City Commercial
    Banks There are altogether 147 city commercial banks in China, including the Bank
    of Shanghai, Bank of Beijing, Tianjin City Commercial Bank, Shenzhen City Commercial
    Bank, Guangzhou City Commercial Bank, Jinan City Commercial Bank, Hangzhou City
    Commercial Bank, Nanjing City Commercial Bank, Ningbo City Commercial Bank, Wuxi
    City Commercial Bank, Wuhan City Commercial Bank and Xian City Commercial Bank
    etc. The Banks of Beijing and Shanghai are the largest city commercial banks.
    According to latest statistics from the CBRC, by the end of 2010, the size of
    deposits and loans in city commercial banks reached RMB 6.1 trillion and RMB 3.6
    trillion respectively, of which loans of small- and medium-enterprises comprise
    RMB 1.1 trillion. By the end of 2010, the outstanding non-performance loans of
    city commercial banks are RMB 32.56 billion, a drop of RMB 5.13 billion compared
    with the beginning of the year; the NPL ratio is 0.9 percent, 0.4 percentage points
    lower than the year beginning; the average capital adequacy ratio is 12.8 percent;
    liquidity ratio is generally in good situation and the leverage ratio is under
    control. 6. Rural Commercial Banks and Rural Credit Cooperatives Rural credit
    cooperatives, much closer to rural areas and farmers than any other banking institutions,
    have created large numbers of financial products which met the needs of rural
    economy and gained popularity among farmers. In the past 60 years, rural credit
    cooperative workers have been dedicated to serving agriculture, rural areas, and
    farmers. Nearly 80,000 branches, with 800,000 workers in counties and rural areas,
    served 0.8 billion rural residents, provided almost 80 percent of rural household
    loans and provided 80 percent financial coverage of the under-banked villages
    and towns in China. In early 2011, the CBRC selected first five Rural Commercial
    Banks, i.e., Beijing Rural Commercial Bank, Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank, Chongqing
    Rural Commercial Bank, Chengdu Rural Commercial Bank, Zhangjiagang Rural Commercial
    Bank, to carry out the implementation of Basel II pilot. In July 2011, CBRC issued
    a "Rural Banking Institutions on the Implementation of Basel II Guidance." The
    implementation of Basel-oriented comprehensive risk management system for rural
    commercial banks is aimed at narrowing their gap with the other commercial banks,
    and to enhance their management level and the core competitiveness and to achieve
    sustainable development. 7. Foreign Banks in China At present, the scope of business
    and regulatory standards for foreign banks registered in China is consistent with
    that for the Chinese banks. A foreign bank registered in China can operate the
    foreign exchange and RMB business to enterprises and individuals, and comply with
    the same requirements as for a Chinese bank in terms of capital adequacy, credit
    concentration limits, savings and loan ratio, liquidity and other prudential provisions.
    Branches of foreign banks can conduct foreign exchange business and limited RMB
    business (only for foreigners in China); those foreign bank branches in China
    that were approved to conduct RMB business can absorb no less than RMB 100 million
    from the Chinese citizen for each deposit. As of the end of September 2011, there
    were 39 foreign banks locally incorporated in China (consists of 247 branches
    and subsidiaries), 1 foreign financial company, 93 foreign bank branches and 207
    representative offices, from 47 different countries. Over the past decade, the
    annual compound growth rate of foreign banks reached 19 percent, and the annual
    compound growth rate of their profits reached 26 percent. The top five locally
    incorporated foreign banks'' assets all exceed of RMB100 billion, which reach
    the level of national joint-stock commercial banks. To become a locally incorporated
    bank in China, a foreign bank needs to apply to the Chinese Banking Regulatory
    Commission, as well as gain approval from SAFE to bring working capital onshore.
    The process of doing so is frequently lengthy.'

  :topic: Visa Requirements
  :industry: 
  :content: 'A valid passport and visa are required to enter China. A visa must be
    obtained from Chinese Embassies and Consulates before traveling to China; ask
    for a one-year, multiple-entry visa. Americans arriving without valid passports
    and the appropriate Chinese visa are not permitted to enter and can be subject
    to a fine and immediate deportation at the traveler''s expense. Travelers should
    not rely on Chinese host organizations claiming to be able to arrange a visa upon
    arrival. Chinese authorities have recently tightened their visa issuance policy,
    in some cases requiring personal interviews of American citizens and regularly
    issuing one or two entry visas valid for short periods only. The standard visa
    reciprocity is multiple entry/12 months and visitors should request a Chinese
    visa of that validity to avoid problems. Please note that visas are required to
    transit China in most circumstances. Persons transiting China on the way to and
    from Mongolia or North Korea or who plan to re-enter from the Hong Kong or Macau
    Special Administrative Regions should be especially sure to obtain visas allowing
    multiple entries. For information about visa requirements and other entry requirements
    and restricted areas, travelers should consult the Embassy of the People''s Republic
    of China (PRC) at 2300 Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, or telephone
    (202) 328-2500, 2501 or 2502. For a list of services and frequently asked visa
    questions and answers, travelers can view the Chinese Embassy''s website at: http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/.
    The Chinese Embassy''s visa section may be reached by e-mail at chnvisa@bellatlantic.net.
    The service hotline is (202) 337-1956 and the fax number is (202) 588-9760. There
    are Chinese Consulates General in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and
    San Francisco. Americans traveling in Asia have been able to obtain visas to enter
    China from the Chinese visa office in Hong Kong and the Embassy of the People''s
    Republic of China in Seoul, South Korea, but Americans resident in the United
    States should apply for a visa before leaving, if possible. Americans who overstay
    or otherwise violate the terms of their Chinese visas will be subject to a RMB
    500 fine per day up to a maximum of RMB 5,000. Although you can expect processing
    delays and receive a warning, you are not necessarily denied a new visa or have
    further action taken against you. In extreme cases, you could be expelled from
    the country and prohibited re-entry for 5 years. Travelers should note that international
    flights departing China are routinely overbooked. Travelers are advised to reconfirm
    departure reservations and check in early at the airport. Note that if you lose
    your passport or become the victim of passport theft, you will not only need to
    obtain a new U.S. passport, but you will need to obtain a replacement visa before
    you will be able to depart China. This process can take as long as one week. In
    an effort to prevent international child abduction, many governments have initiated
    new procedures at entry/exit points. These often include requiring documentary
    evidence of relationship and permission for the child''s travel from the parent(s)
    or legal guardian if they are not present. Having such documentation on hand,
    even if not required, may facilitate entry/departure. U.S. companies that require
    travel of foreign businesspeople to the United States should be advised that,
    especially during the summer and during other busy travel times, there may be
    a significant wait time for applicants to schedule a visa interview and a small
    percentage of Chinese visa applicants, particularly those in scientific and technical
    fields, require additional processing that may take three weeks or more to complete.
    Chinese companies also usually require invitation letters and have internal travel
    approval process that may take several weeks. U.S. companies should send invitation
    letters to Chinese business contacts as early as possible. Visa applicants should
    go to the following links. State Department Visa Website: http://travel.state.gov/visa/index.html

  :industry: 
  :content: 'Western-style medical facilities with international staffs are available
    in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and a few other large cities. Many other hospitals
    in major Chinese cities have so-called VIP wards (gaogan bingfang). These feature
    reasonably up-to-date medical technology and physicians who are both knowledgeable
    and skilled. Most VIP wards also provide medical services to foreigners and have
    English-speaking doctors and nurses. Most hospitals in China will not accept medical
    insurance from the United States, with the exception of the following hospitals,
    which are on the BlueCross BlueShield''s worldwide network providers - overseas
    network hospitals'' list (http://www.fepblue.org/wasite/wabenefits/wa-benefitsoverseas04.html):
    Beijing United Family Hospital, Beijing Friendship Hospital, International Medical
    Center in Beijing, and Peking Union Medical Center. Travelers will be asked to
    post a deposit prior to admission to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals
    in major cities may accept credit cards for payment. Even in the VIP/Foreigner
    wards of major hospitals, however, American patients have frequently encountered
    difficulty due to language, cultural, and regulatory differences. Physicians and
    hospitals have sometimes refused to supply American patients with complete copies
    of their Chinese hospital medical records, including laboratory test results,
    scans, and x-rays. All Americans traveling to China are strongly encouraged to
    buy foreign medical care and medical evacuation insurance prior to arrival. Travelers
    who want a list of medical facilities in China that will treat foreigners can
    access that information at the Embassy''s website. Information for consular districts
    can be accessed by clicking "locations" in the upper right-hand corner of this
    site. Ambulances do not carry sophisticated medical equipment, and ambulance personnel
    generally have little or no medical training. Therefore, injured or seriously
    ill Americans may be required to take taxis or other immediately available vehicles
    to the nearest major hospital rather than waiting for ambulances to arrive. In
    rural areas, only rudimentary medical facilities are generally available. Rural
    clinics are often reluctant to accept responsibility for treating foreigners,
    even in emergency situations. Medical Insurance The Department of State strongly
    urges Americans to consult with their medical insurance company prior to traveling
    abroad to confirm whether their policy applies overseas and if it will cover emergency
    expenses such as a medical evacuation. U.S. medical insurance plans seldom cover
    health costs incurred outside the United States unless on a reimbursable basis
    or if supplemental coverage is purchased. Furthermore, U.S. Medicare and Medicaid
    programs do not provide payment for any medical services outside the United States.
    However, many travel agents and private companies offer insurance plans that will
    cover health care expenses incurred overseas, including emergency services such
    as medical evacuations. When making a decision regarding health insurance, Americans
    should consider that many foreign doctors and hospitals require payment in cash
    prior to providing service and that a medical evacuation to the U.S., or even
    to Hong Kong, may cost well in excess of USD 100,000. Uninsured travelers who
    require medical care overseas often face extreme difficulties. When consulting
    with your insurer prior to your trip, ascertain whether payment will be made to
    the overseas healthcare provider or if you will be reimbursed later for expenses
    you incur. Some insurance policies also include coverage for psychiatric treatment
    and for disposition of remains in the event of death. Two private emergency medical
    assistance firms, SOS International, Ltd., and Medex Assistance Corporation, offer
    medical insurance policies designed for travelers. Both of these companies have
    staff in China who can assist with a medical emergency. SOS International, Ltd.

    Other Health Information Most roads and towns in Tibet, Qinghai, parts of Xinjiang,
    and western Sichuan are situated at altitudes over 10,000 feet. Travelers in these
    areas should seek medical advice in advance of travel, allow time for acclimatization
    to the high altitude, and remain alert to signs of altitude sickness. Reuse or
    poor sterilization practices are problems in China, contributing to transmission
    of diseases such as hepatitis, which is endemic in China. In order to protect
    themselves from blood and other tissue borne disease such as hepatitis and HIV,
    travelers should always ask doctors and dentists to use sterilized equipment and
    be prepared to pay for new syringe needles in hospitals or clinics. Tuberculosis
    is endemic in China. Air pollution is also a significant problem throughout China.
    Travelers should consult their doctor prior to travel and consider the impact
    seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on them. Travelers are
    advised to consult the CDC''s traveler''s health website at: http://www.cdc.gov/travel/eastasia.htm
    prior to departing for China.'
