        stable construction market and a robust green building segment driven by market
        forces and government policies, Canada is a large potential market for U.S.
        exporters. Infrastructure projects will include repair of traffic arteries,
        local roads, street lighting, bike paths, renovation work, investments in
        water infrastructures, and smart city technology investments.\u003cbr /\u003e\\nEleven

        years starting in 2017-18 to support clean technology including forestry,
